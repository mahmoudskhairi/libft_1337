    <p>
        <code>libft</code> is a custom implementation of a subset of the C standard library functions, developed as part of the 42 school curriculum. The project aims to deepen understanding of fundamental C programming concepts and standard library mechanisms by reconstructing    commonly used functions from scratch. By the end of this project, students will have built a robust and reusable library that can be utilized in future projects.
